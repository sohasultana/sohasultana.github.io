# Portfolio

Hello, I am Soha Sultana, a senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a focus in data science. I am passionate about using data to tell a story and have developed projects where I have created machine learning models to help answer a research question, and am exploring more using Agentic AI.

# About Me
I develop projects that are dedicated to giving back to my community. I have developed projects using Java, HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and SQL. My future career goals include becoming a full-stack developer, where I would like to strengthen my programming skills to build innovative and effective solutions that serve my community.

My Methodology for designing such projects starts with identifying an issue that my community is facing, and finding out how I can use technology to solve that issue. I start with understanding the criteria and contraints I am given and use the Software Developmental Model to test out my projects and to continually improve them.  

# Projects

# Aria MVP 
**Timeframe:** November 2025 - Present  
**Role:** Back-end Developr  
**Tools:** Python, AWS Bedrock 
**Link:** https://github.com/sohasultana/Aria

## About the Project
This project consists of developing a low-level MVP of an AI agent called Aria that helps a user plan their day-to-day tasks.

For this project, I developed the back-end workstream which consisted of a data layer to store user information.

I also created sample models that the agent can use via AWS Bedrock when deciding on what task to perform.

In order for user data to be pulled from various locations, I implemented router functions.

Finally, I created a services function which is reponsible for calling the LLM orchestration.

# Let's Find Dinner

**Timeframe:** September 2023 - December 2023  
**Role:** Full Stack Developer  
**Tools:** HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, GitHub  
**Link:** https://github.com/sohasultana/sohasultana.github.io/tree/main/lets-find-dinner 

## About the Project
This project connected users to local food banks in the Seattle area. The app consists of four main sections:

- **About Page:** Explains the purpose of the app and its services.

- **Profile Section:** Allows users to create a profile for volunteering or using food bank services.

## Deliverables
I was responsible for creating the volunteer form for the users. This included:
- Using **HTML** and **JavaScript** to create different form sections (name, age, zip code, contact information).
- Implementing validation protocols with **JavaScript** to ensure:
  - Only users older than 13 can volunteer.
  - Correct format for email and phone number.

# Instacart Database

**Timeframe:** January 2024 - March 2024  
**Role:** Database Design  
**Tools:** SQL, Azure Data Studio
**Link:** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13upIJfQKCd0TFLrQI0vJaUULjzw1AbgwI5Eeh7BTBJA/edit?usp=sharing

## About the Project
This project consisted of creating a database using SQL for the information system Instacart, which is a website that compares different grocery store prices. The database stores information such as customers, orders, stores, and delivery data. In addition, we also used stored procedures to streamline the process of adding and retrieving data.

## Deliverables
I created the Order table which tracks the order details:

When creating the data table, I focused on normalization techniques, such as identifying the primary and foreign keys. After this, I worked with my teammates to get the ERD into third normal form, to ensure there were no redundant values. Additionally, I managed the data by creating a stored procedure called `GetCustomerID`, which is used to add a new customer into the database using the same code to increase efficiency.

I also created another stored procedure, `newStoreID`, that adds a new grocery store into the database:
